# Eye Movement
Eye movement is an animation exercise where the eye balls follow the cursor in every direction just as two normal eyes would.

## How to run?
Make sure to have all three files on your local machine i.e. index.html, eye.js, style.css. After that jus the html file on your browser.

## Future Improvements
In future i plan to add a full face where this animation would feel a little more complete with the face expressions as well.
